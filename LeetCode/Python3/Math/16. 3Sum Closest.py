# Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, 
# find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
# Return the sum of the three integers. 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

# Example:
# Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
# The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
