# # Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
# # Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

# # Example:
# # Input: n = 10
# # Output: 12
# # Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

# # Note:  
# # 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
# # n does not exceed 1690.

# # Hints:
# The naive approach is to call isUgly for every number until you reach the nth one. 
# Most numbers are not ugly. Try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.
# An ugly number must be multiplied by either 2, 3, or 5 from a smaller ugly number.
# The key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers. 
# Try a similar approach of merging from three sorted lists: L1, L2, and L3.
# Assume you have Uk, the kth ugly number. Then Uk+1 must be Min(L1 * 2, L2 * 3, L3 * 5).
