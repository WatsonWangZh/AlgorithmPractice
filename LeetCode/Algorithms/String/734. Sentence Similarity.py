# Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), 
# and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.
# For example, "great acting skills" and "fine drama talent" are similar, 
# if the similar word pairs are pairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].
# Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. 
# For example, if "great" and "fine" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, 
# "great" and "good" are not necessarily similar.
# However, similarity is symmetric. 
# For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.
# Also, a word is always similar with itself. 
# For example, the sentences words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] are similar, 
# even though there are no specified similar word pairs.
# Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. 
# So a sentence like words1 = ["great"] can never be similar to words2 = ["doubleplus","good"].

# Note:
# The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
# The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
# The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
# The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].

# Hints:
# Two words w1 and w2 are similar if and only if w1 == w2, 
# (w1, w2) was a pair, or (w2, w1) was a pair.
