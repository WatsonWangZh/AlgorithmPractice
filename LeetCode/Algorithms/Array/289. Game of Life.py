# According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, 
# is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
# Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). 
# Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules 
# (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
# Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. 
# The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, 
# where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

# Example:
# Input: 
# [
#   [0,1,0],
#   [0,0,1],
#   [1,1,1],
#   [0,0,0]
# ]
# Output: 
# [
#   [0,0,0],
#   [1,0,1],
#   [0,1,1],
#   [0,1,0]
# ]

# Follow up:
# Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: 
# You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
# In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, 
# which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. 
# How would you address these problems?
