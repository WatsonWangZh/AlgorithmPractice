# Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, 
# find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.

# Example:
# Input:
#    1
#     \
#      3
#     /
#    2
# Output:
# 1
# Explanation:
# The minimum absolute difference is 1, 
# which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).

# Definition for a binary tree node.
