# Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
# write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
# "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
# and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

# Example:
# Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
#              received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
#              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
#              two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
# Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

# Hints:
# An easy approach is to sort the array first.
# What are the possible values of h-index?
# A faster approach is to use extra space.
