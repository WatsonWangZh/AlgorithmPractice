# Problem
# There are N houses for sale. The i-th house costs Ai dollars to buy. 
# You have a budget of B dollars to spend.
# What is the maximum number of houses you can buy?

# Input
# The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. 
# Each test case begins with a single line containing the two integers N and B. 
# The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai, the cost of the i-th house.

# Output
# For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, 
# where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of houses you can buy.

# Limits
# Time limit: 15 seconds per test set.
# Memory limit: 1GB.
# 1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
# 1 ≤ B ≤ 105.
# 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000, for all i.

# Test set 1
# 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.

# Test set 2
# 1 ≤ N ≤ 105.

# Sample
# Input
# 3
# 4 100
# 20 90 40 90
# 4 50
# 30 30 10 10
# 3 300
# 999 999 999

# Output 
# Case #1: 2
# Case #2: 3
# Case #3: 0

# In Sample Case #1, you have a budget of 100 dollars. 
# You can buy the 1st and 3rd houses for 20 + 40 = 60 dollars.
# In Sample Case #2, you have a budget of 50 dollars. 
# You can buy the 1st, 3rd and 4th houses for 30 + 10 + 10 = 50 dollars.
# In Sample Case #3, you have a budget of 300 dollars. 
# You cannot buy any houses (so the answer is 0).
# Note: Unlike previous editions, in Kick Start 2020, all test sets are visible verdict test sets, 
# meaning you receive instant feedback upon submission.
